    "This series with coefficients determined by the integrals may be used in the solution of [ordinary differential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) and [partial differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation).  In materials engineering you will sometimes see diffusion problems use series solutions to describe the evolution of a concentration field where there is a factor composed of an infinite series and a factor containing an exponential in time.  Together they are selected to describe the diffusive evolution of a system.  A classic example of a [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) in the solution to a diffusion problem is in Jackson and Hunt's paper on eutectic solidification.  In that paper the boundary condition was represented by a Fourier series to model the composition profile across eutectic lamellae."
